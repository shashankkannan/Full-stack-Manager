Project Manager: Automated Full-Stack App Setup and Management
Welcome to the Project Manager! This tool automates the creation, setup, and management of full-stack applications. It supports Flask, Express.js, and Django for the backend, and automatically creates a React.js frontend with all necessary dependencies.

Features
Automated Full-Stack App Setup:

Instantly set up Flask, Express, or Django backend servers.
Automatically create a React.js frontend application with essential dependencies.
Port Management:

Dynamically assigns available ports to each new app to avoid conflicts.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Supports both Windows and Linux environments.
Backend and Frontend Management:

Backend: Set up Flask, Express, or Django servers.
Frontend: Set up React.js and install necessary libraries like react-router-dom, axios, and cross-env.
Technologies Used
Flask: Python-based web framework for building backend APIs.
Express.js: Node.js web framework for handling server-side logic.
Django: Python-based framework for rapid backend development.
React.js: Frontend framework for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Node.js: Runtime environment for running JavaScript-based apps like Express and React.
AJV, React Router DOM, Axios, Cross-env: Key libraries for React app development.
